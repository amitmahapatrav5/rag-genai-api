## Question 1
How can I load a Python file object (that contains a Markdown file) using LangChainâ€™s `UnstructuredMarkdownLoader`?

From what I understand, the `UnstructuredMarkdownLoader` is typically designed to load Markdown files from a specified file path. It does not directly accept a Python file object as input.

Is there a way to adapt or extend the loader so that it can work with an in-memory file object (e.g., from `io.BytesIO` or `io.StringIO`) instead of requiring a file path on disk? If not, what would be the best workaround?
