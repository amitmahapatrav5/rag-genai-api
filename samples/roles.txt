Personal Experience
===================
Finance Tracker:
# Point# 1: Goal of the Project
	- Store all the "expenses I make everyday categrically", "all my income sources" and "investments" in a reliable and accessible format.
		- I am storing all the data in a database. This way my data is safe and gurenteed that it will not be lost. Also, database storage gives me a programatic access to the data, so I can query it however I want.
	- Visualize the past data of all the above 3 aspects in various parameter(e.g. time)
		- "one picture tells a thousand words". Looking at the data in graphs and charts will provide me much more insight that only number cannot.
	- Draw insights from the past data to help me take precise decisions in future.
		- Example of this is, I can create a monthly budget and specify exactly **how much money, do I have to spend on my needs and howmuch money can I spend on my wants**. This will prevent me from impulsive purchases. Another example can be Category data can provide me insights like "Howmuch money am I investing on my health and how can I improve it. The reason this is important is because my health is my highest priority". Another example can be "Tracking Infletion and based on that I can take steps to increase my income and investments". Another example can be "Understanding my net value from my expense, income and investment data." There could be several other examples.
# Point# 2: Key Functionalities
	- "Automatic weekly Batch Migration" From Excel workbook to Database
	- "Charts" - to visualize data
	- "Monthly Budget" calculation (basically how much more money can I spend more in need and want)
	- "Displaying the current Net Worth" Based on the data in all the 3 aspects
# Point# 3: Future Plans
	- "Inflation Indicator" - Building a product page which specify the "average cost of any already purchased product". 
	- Building a "Future Wealth Monitor" which will display the approximate wealth built with current investment rate.
	- "Impulsive Purchase Monitor"
# Point# 4: Technologies Used
	- Python, openpyxl, Django RESTAPI, Django ORM, PostgreSQL, JWT, ReactJS, D3js, Swagger, Postman, Git and Github, Heroku, LLM, (Code)[Github Repo Link], (Code)[Live Website Link]

Habit Tracker
=============
# Point# 1: Goal of the Project
	- Recording my day in terms of habits via forms in an excel and then migrating the data with additional meta information to the database.
		- I am storing all the data in a database. This way my data is safe and gurenteed that it will not be lost. Also, database storage gives me a programatic access to the data, so I can query it however I want.	
	- Visualize the past data of any particular habit.
		- "one picture tells a thousand words". Looking at the data in graphs and charts will provide me much more insight that only number cannot.
	- Draw insights from the past data to help me take precise decisions in future.
		- Example of this can be like, "I have observed that the days when I wake up late, the acticities of the days do not go very well and even few actvities are skipped". This I can use to give myself more attention on how can I wake up early. Also I can plan my sleeep in a way that will remove some resistance from waking up early.
# Point# 2: Key Functionalities
	- "Automatic weekly Batch Migration" From Excel workbook to Database
	- "Charts" - to visualize data
	- "Streak Calculation" - This is a measure which tells howmany days I have performed the habit without missing it for 2 days continuously.
# Point# 3: Future Plans
	- "Reward Points Generator" - Like good habits, I will intrduce forms for my bad habits as well (like using netflix). For every good habit which I complete in the decided time, I will reward some points to myself and for every bad habit, I will loose some points. This will indicate howmany points have I gained everyday and then week, month, year and decade. This number will motimate me to work harder to make my day even more better and more productive.
	- "Graph like we have in LeetCode" to track no of submissions Or GitHub to track commit. This is tricky, but really a value adder.
	- Sentiment Evaluation
# Point# 4: Technologies Used
	- Python, openpyxl, Django RESTAPI, Django ORM, PostgreSQL, JWT, ReactJS, D3js, Swagger, Postman, Git and Github, Heroku, LLM, (Code)[Github Repo Link], (Code)[Live Website Link]
